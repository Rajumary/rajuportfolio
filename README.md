****This is my Portfolio Website:****
Welcome to my C# Developer Portfolio! This repository contains the work and projects I've completed during my C# development course. Throughout this course, I’ve gained hands-on experience with various features and tools in C#, .NET, and related technologies. Below, you can find details on the projects I’ve built, as well as a summary of my technical skills.

**Projects**
**1. Blackjack Game**
**Description:** I developed a text-based Blackjack game using C#. The game uses object-oriented programming principles to handle card decks, player actions, and game rules. I also incorporated error handling and exception management.
Key Concepts: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, file I/O.
**Technologies:** C#, .NET Core
***2. Employee Management System*
**Description:** A simple console application that manages employee data. The program allows users to add, update, and remove employee records, while also implementing LINQ queries to filter employee data by various attributes.
Key Concepts: Classes, properties, LINQ, collections (Lists, Dictionaries), data filtering.
**Technologies:** C#, .NET Core
**3. C# Math Operations**
**Description:** A simple program that takes user input for various math operations and performs calculations. The program uses multiple methods, method overloading, and exception handling to ensure robust user interaction.
Key Concepts: Methods, method overloading, exception handling, user input handling.
**Technologies:** C#
**Skills**
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** I learned and applied OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation to design and implement robust software solutions.

**C# Syntax & Data Structures:** Gained a deep understanding of C# syntax, including variable declarations, loops, conditionals, collections, and more.

**Error Handling & Debugging:** Learned to handle exceptions gracefully using try-catch blocks and debug code with Visual Studio’s tools (breakpoints, step-through, watch variables).

**File I/O:** Gained experience in reading and writing files in C#, enabling me to persist and retrieve user data.

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** Used LINQ for data querying and manipulation within collections, improving code readability and functionality.

**Console Applications:** Developed console applications that interact with users, accept input, perform operations, and return results.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
**C#:** The primary programming language for building various console applications.
**.NET Core:** Framework used for building and running C# applications.
**Visual Studio:** IDE for writing, debugging, and testing C# code.
**GitHub:** Used for version control and project management.
**Git:** Version control system for managing project history and collaboration.
**LINQ:** A powerful feature in C# used for querying collections in a declarative manner.
**Entity Framework Core:** Used in some projects for database interactions.
